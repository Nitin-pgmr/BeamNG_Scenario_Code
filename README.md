#crash and Burn PY
Requires BeamNG research 1.4 and above

BeamNGpy is an official library providing a Python interface to BeamNG.research, the research-oriented fork of the video game BeamNG.drive.

It allows control of the simulation, including vehicles contained in it:

Simulates the crash of ego vehicle with a target vehicle


Observe the behavior of the car by running as many simulations parallely as possible

Use the custom Mytest(Simple) for simulating the Scenario
  



The scenario can be customized by configuring MyMap.

Sensors pertaining to electronics are added and damage is also retrieved
